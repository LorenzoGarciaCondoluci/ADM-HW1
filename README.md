###**scripts.ipynb** is a Jupyter notebook that contains the codes used to solve Hackerrank's exercises.\
###**stamps/** is a folder where there are two PDFs files. These files contain the screenshots of all the exercises i managed to solve and also the attempts.

###**Remark**: I managed to solve every assigned challenge but in some cases i had to look at the 'Discussions'.
In the following lines a list of challenges where i had to look for help:
1] Alphabet Rangoli
2] Piling up!
3] Matrix script
4] Time delta
5] Decorators 2
6] Insertion Sort - Part 1
7] Insertion Sort - Part 
I had many troubles with 'Regex and parsing' too especially in the last challenges. However, after looking for help in the 'Discussions' for the fist exercises, i managed to do the others alone.
